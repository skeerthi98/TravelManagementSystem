Reading to be completed with analysis

 

1. Read about Javascript operators, Typescript operators. Compare the two and come out with the operators missing in javascript.

Javascript operators:

Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
Comparison Operators (==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=)
Logical Operators (&&,||,!)
Bitwise Operators (&,|,^,~,<<,>>,>>>)
Assignment Operators (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
Conditional (or ternary) Operators (?:)
String Operators (+,+=)
typeof, yield, void, new, instanceof, in, delete

Typescript operators:

Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
Relational operators (==,!=,>,<,>=,<=)
Logical operators (&&,||,!)
Bitwise operators (&,|,^,~,<<,>>,>>>)
Assignment operators (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
Ternary/conditional operator (?:) 
String operator (+,+=)
Type Operator (typeof, instanceof)
negation operator (-), Spread Operator(...)

No difference in operators available in Javascript and Typescript.


2. Read about looping & conditional constructs in Javascript Vs Typescript. Come out with the missing operators.

looping & conditional constructs in Javascript:

conditional constructs: (if-else,switch)

looping constructs: (for,while,do-while)

looping & conditional constructs in Typescript:

conditional constructs: (if-else,switch)

looping constructs: (for,for-in,for-of,while,do-while)

for-of loop is missing in Javascript.

3. Read through VCS & Git.
